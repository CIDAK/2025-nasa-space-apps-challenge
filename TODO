# TODO 

Task for cidak developers: add @github-handle after tasks.


## <span style="color: green;">Phase 1 Foundation</span> @DylanPrinsloo
- [x] index.html at project root, entry: /src/main.js
- [x] Vite dev server configured (use npx vite or npm run dev)
- [x] Dependencies: three, webxr-polyfill, vite
- [x] Basic Three.js scene scaffold (VRButton, renderer.xr enabled) 
- [x] Add README.md and docs/SETUP.md with headset instructions @docs

- [ ] **Story Concept** (Keep it simple - 2-3 minutes) 
  - [ ] Pick ONE compelling RCM story: 
      - [ ] Maritime surveillance (ice, surface wind, oil pollution and ship monitoring) 
      - [ ] Disaster management (mitigation, warning, response and recovery)
      - [ ]Ecosystem monitoring (agriculture, wetlands, forestry and coastal change monitoring)
        - Add ons:
          - [ ] Option 1: Distance the sat is at, and what it picks up. Use realworld objects to show this distance
          - [ ] Option: Oil spill detection and ocean pollution (Could we do realtime?)
    - 
  - [ ] Write 1-paragraph narrative arc
  - [ ] Sketch 3-5 key scenes


## <span style="color: blue;">Phase 2 Data + Scene</span> 

- [ ] Load preprocessed RADARSAT frames from /assets/data_processed/frames/ -> @ianthehamster and @DylanPrinsloo
- [ ] Display one RADARSAT frame on an in-scene panel -> @ianthehamster
- [ ] Desktop fallback controls (OrbitControls) -> @Alexsandra-m-silva
- [ ] Simple platform / placeholder ocean (CircleGeometry or Water shader)  -> @DylanPrinsloo

## <span style="color: orange;">Phase 3 Interaction & UX</span> 

- [ ] Gaze/click to open info panels (raycast) @ux -> @DylanPrinsloo
- [ ] Basic movement/teleport (controller + desktop) -> @ianthehamster
- [ ] Subtitles/narration playback sync (assets/audio/) @media ->  @Alexsandra-m-silva

## <span style="color: lightblue;">Phase 4 Polish & Performance</span> 

- [ ] Texture size optimization and sRGB encoding @perf -> @DylanPrinsloo
- [ ] Smooth transitions between frames (fade/crossfade) -> @ianthehamster, @Alexsandra-m-silva and @DylanPrinsloo
- [ ] Credits and data attribution (ASC-CSA) @docs -> @Alexsandra-m-silva, @DylanPrinsloo

## <span style="color: orangered;">Phase 5 Testing & Deploy</span> 

- [ ] Test on Meta Quest browser and desktop Chrome/Edge @tester @ianthehamster
- [ ] Ensure headset access: run `npx vite --host` or use ngrok @infra
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages -> @DylanPrinsloo or @Alexsandra-m-silva or @ianthehamster


- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [x] [Setup instructions](docs/SETUP.md)
  - [ ] Document RADARSAT data sources
  - [ ] Create 1-page project description
  - [ ] Take screenshots/screen recording for demo
  - [ ] Prepare 5-minute pitch presentation
  - [ ] QR code for easy access to WebXR experience

## MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT (MVP) Checklist
**Must-haves to complete the challenge:**
- [ ] Runs locally
- [ ] On Headset or Web-experience
- [ ] Uses RADARSAT RCM data visualizations
- [ ] 5 minute ocean-related story
- [ ] Basic 3D ocean environment
- [ ] Simple narration or text explanation
- [ ] User can navigate/interact with data
- [ ] Proper data attribution to ASC-CSA (Data attribution present)


## Tips from previous entries

1. **Use existing ocean assets** - Don't build from scratch
2. **Focus on ONE compelling data story** - Don't try to show everything
3. **Pre-process RADARSAT data** - Have clean images ready to drop in
4. **Record narration early** - Helps structure the experience
5. **Test in VR frequently** - Catch issues early
6. **Keep interactions simple** - Gaze + click is enough
7. **Use template code** - Start from A-Frame or Three.js examples
